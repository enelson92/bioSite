      <p class="bio">
        Lori Lucente-Nelson is an <span class="bold">award-winning</span> real estate agent in Orlando,
        FL. As a member of both the <span class="bold">RE/MAX Executive Club</span> and the <span class="bold">100 Club</span>,
        Lori’s main goal is to help home buyers get the house of their dreams.
        As a real estate agent, Lori works with buyers looking to find their
        forever home, as well as with sellers who are looking to relocate to
        their forever home. Lori has lived in Orlando, FL for 20 years, which
        makes her an invaluable resource in locating and selecting neighborhoods
        and homes for her clients.

        Prior to her successful real estate career, Lori was an educational
        professional in several spheres. She ran one of the top Gymboree Play
        Program franchises for children based out of Dearborn Heights, Michigan.
        Additionally, she was a veteran school teacher for some of the private
        and charter schools in the West Orlando area.

      <p class="bio">
        When she is not working and breaking real estate records, Lori enjoys
        traveling and spending time with her family and friends. She enjoys
        creating new memories with her family and children, whether that is
        going on a Disney Cruise Line vacation, or staying at home watching
        movies with freshly made air-popped popcorn. One of her greatest
        passions is her children. She is the mother to six beautiful children,
        two of which are adopted (one daughter is from Guatemala, and one
        daughter is from China). Lori currently resides in Orlando, FL with her
        family and Australian Shepherd, Zoey.
