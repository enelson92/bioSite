      <p class="hobbies">
        Between a booming real-estate career and caring for her family as a
        single mother, Lori keeps a busy schedule. However, she still makes time
        to do things that she enjoys. Whether she is going down the street for
        ice cream, planning a cruise vacation, or making a cross-country trip to
        the West Coast, she always makes sure that her family is the focus, and
        that they are always a part of it.

      <h2 class="underlined">Web Page Inspiration</h2>
      <h3 class="underlined">Colors</h3>
      <p class="inspiration">
        Lori’s favorite color is purple, which can have both light and dark hues
        and shades. When I asked her to describe herself in a color, she said
        purple because it matches her personality. Therefore, I wanted to pay
        homage to this by choosing these hues for my color scheme.
      </p>
      <h3 class="underlined">Fonts</h3>
      <p class="inspiration">
        Because Lori is a real estate agent, I wanted to design the website that
        was influenced by the tone of the real estate industry. Because real
        estate involves hundreds of thousands (if not millions of) dollars, I
        wanted to make sure the fonts used in the font design included serif, as
        the tone of the fonts creates more of a sophisticated feel, while still
        maintaining a sense of modernism.
      </p>
      <h3 class="underlined">Web Page Structure</h3>
      <p class="inspiration">
        I was influenced by other real estate website designs. Overall, a
        majority of websites are designed in a simple way. This makes the site
        not only user-friendly, but provides the sense that the agent is taking
        care of the client in its simplicity. I really enjoyed this website from
        Luxury Presence Real Estate, due to its simple design and contrasting
        colors. Instead of the black background, I intend on using a light
        pink/purple background color for the body of the website. Additionally,
        I like having the header be visible to the user at all times, no matter
        where you are on the page.

      <h3 class="underlined">Website Tone/Background Photos</h3>
      <p class="inspiration">
        For any background photos for the header or body, I wanted to include a
        picture of a pristine house or neighborhood. When interviewing Lori, I
        really enjoyed how she said that she’s not a salesperson; rather, she is
        a matchmaker to find your dream home. Therefore, I wanted to use images
        that reflected this “dream-like” tone of what “home” might feel like.
